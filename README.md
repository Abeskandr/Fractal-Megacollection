# Fractal Collection

A collection of Fractals that i made in Unity using image effects (game window as canvas).

Developed between October 2017 and February 2018. I didn't have WiFi during that period, hence the file dump.

It includes:

	Complex Number operations
	9 Different Mandelbrot Rendering Techniques
	Basic Fractal Types
	Animated fractal shaders
	Custom ShaderGUI to export images from pixel shaders in Unity

Need help with the algorithms? Shoot me an email!

	Hue
	Cheap Interior Distance Estimation


# Extra

I found a lack of pseudocode on wikipedia. The only article that i found that had some was the Mandelbrot Set, so i decided to add pseudocode of my own based on my implementations.

I added it for the following articles:
    
* [Tricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tricorn_(mathematics))
* [Burning Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal)

* [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)
	
* [Pickover Stalk](url)

* [Newton Fractal](url)
